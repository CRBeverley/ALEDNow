Your 2020 Annual Report is now due.  As of June 5th, our records 
indicate your 2020 Annual Report has not been filed.  Please 
disregard this notice if you have filed the report since June 
5, 2020.

Pursuant to Executive Order No. 20-52 and Department of State 
Emergency Order 2020-01, signed March 27, 2020, the Department 
of State suspended and tolled the May 1st Annual Report filing 
requirements for the year 2020 until June 30, 2020. Business 
entities subject to the $400 late fee pursuant to section 607.193, 
F.S. (profit corporations, limited liability companies, limited 
partnerships and limited liability limited partnerships) have 
until midnight EST on June 30, 2020, to file their report before 
a $400 late fee is assessed.  

An annual report is a required report that is used to update 
or confirm the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations' 
records.  It is not a financial statement.  An annual report 
must be filed each year for your business entity to maintain 
an active status with the Department of State, and is required 
regardless of whether you need to make changes or not.  All annual 
reports must be filed online at www.sunbiz.org.

Click on Annual Report under Filing Services to complete your 
filing.  Data displayed on the online annual report form is the 
most current data on file with this division.  Please review 
your data carefully and make changes where necessary.  Filing 
instructions are available on the website, and you may pay by 
credit card, check or through a prepaid Sunbiz E-File Account.

Remember to file before July 1st.  It is easy, quick and secure! 
A $400 non-negotiable late fee will be imposed on any profit 
corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership and 
limited liability limited partnership annual report filed after 
midnight Eastern Standard Time on June 30th.  Non-profit corporations 
are not subject to the $400 late fee. Any business entity which 
fails to file its annual report by the third Friday of September 
will be administratively dissolved or revoked in our records 
on the fourth Friday in September.

Administratively dissolved or revoked entities may be reinstated 
by submitting a reinstatement application and paying all associated 
fees, which include the reinstatement fee and annual report fees 
due, at the time of submission.

Sunbiz.org remains the only official website of the Department 
of State, Division of Corporations.  You will know you are in 
the right place when you see our official Sunbiz.org logo and 
header identifying the website as an official State of Florida 
website.
