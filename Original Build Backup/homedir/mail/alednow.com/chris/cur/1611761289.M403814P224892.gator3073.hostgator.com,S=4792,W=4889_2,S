Your 2021 Annual Report is now due.  As of January 23, 2021, 
our records indicate your 2021 Annual Report form has not been 
filed. Please disregard this notice if you have filed the report 
since January 23, 2021.

Annual reports for all corporations, limited liability companies, 
limited partnerships and limited liability limited partnerships 
are due each year between January 1st and May 1st.  

An annual report is a required report that is used to update 
or confirm the Florida Department of State, Division of Corporations' 
records.  It is not a financial statement.
An annual report must be filed each year for your business entity 
to maintain an active status with the Department of State, and 
is required regardless of whether you need to make changes or 
not.  All annual reports must be filed online at www.sunbiz.org.

Click on Annual Report under Filing Services to complete your 
filing.  Data displayed on the online annual report form is the 
most current data on file with this division.  Please review 
your data carefully and make changes where necessary.  Filing 
instructions are available on the website, and you may pay by 
credit card, check or through a prepaid Sunbiz E-File Account.

Remember to file on or before May 1st.  It is easy, quick and 
secure!  A $400 non-negotiable late fee will be imposed on any 
profit corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership 
and limited liability limited partnership annual report filed 
after midnight Eastern Standard Time on May 1st.  Non-profit 
corporations are not subject to the $400 late fee.  Any business 
entity which fails to file its annual report by the third Friday 
of September will be administratively dissolved or revoked in 
our records on the fourth Friday in September.

Administratively dissolved or revoked entities may be reinstated 
by submitting a reinstatement application and paying all associated 
fees, which include the reinstatement fee and annual report fees 
due, at the time of submission.

Sunbiz.org remains the only official website of the Department 
of State, Division of Corporations.  You will know you are in 
the right place when you see our official Sunbiz.org logo and 
header identifying the website as an official State of Florida 
website.

                                                        File 
Early, Florida!
